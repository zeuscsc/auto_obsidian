## Microservices
### Misconceptions about Microservices

Microservices is a popular architectural approach, but many teams often misunderstand its value and costs. The key defining characteristics of microservices are that they are small, focused on accomplishing a single task, aligned with a bounded context, autonomous, independently deployable, and loosely coupled.

### Distributed Systems Architecture

The first problem is that microservices is a distributed systems architecture, making them more complicated than non-distributed systems. RESTful APIs alone do not define a microservice, and not all services are microservices.  [![[/snapshots/zzMLg3Ys5vI/00-01-47.png]]](<https://youtu.be/zzMLg3Ys5vI?t=103s>)

### Characteristics in Detail

- **Small**: The size of a microservice should be such that it is understandable and can be reimplemented within a few days or weeks. [![[/snapshots/zzMLg3Ys5vI/00-02-24.png]]](<https://youtu.be/zzMLg3Ys5vI?t=141s>)
- **Focused on a single task**: The microservice should be able to accomplish one single task when viewed from outside. [![[/snapshots/zzMLg3Ys5vI/00-04-20.png]]](<https://youtu.be/zzMLg3Ys5vI?t=253s>)
- **Aligned with a bounded context**: Microservices should be aligned with natural firebreaks in the problem domain, making the system naturally less coupled. 
- **Autonomous**: Microservices should work in isolation, without the need to interact with other services or teams. [![[/snapshots/zzMLg3Ys5vI/00-08-03.png]]](<https://youtu.be/zzMLg3Ys5vI?t=476s>)
- **Independently deployable**: This aspect of autonomy allows organizations to scale significantly and create software at a faster rate. [![[/snapshots/zzMLg3Ys5vI/00-13-18.png]]](<https://youtu.be/zzMLg3Ys5vI?t=792s>)
- **Loosely coupled**: Microservices must be loosely coupled to maintain independence. [![[/snapshots/zzMLg3Ys5vI/00-15-45.png]]](<https://youtu.be/zzMLg3Ys5vI?t=938s>)

### Microservices vs Service-Based Design

Microservices allow organizations to grow and create software at a faster rate due to their organizational and developmental decoupling. However, service-based designs are also valuable and have a long history in computer science. Service-oriented systems can be organized in various ways, such as distributed monoliths or microservices. [![[/snapshots/zzMLg3Ys5vI/00-13-05.png]]](<https://youtu.be/zzMLg3Ys5vI?t=778s>)

### The Real Value and Cost of Microservices [![[/snapshots/zzMLg3Ys5vI/00-08-22.png]]](<https://youtu.be/zzMLg3Ys5vI?t=497s>)

The real value of microservices is in their ability to decouple organizations, allowing them to create software at a faster pace. The real cost lies in maintaining that independence, taking separation in external and internal representations seriously, and avoiding breaking changes. Microservices are beneficial for organizational growth, but they require investment in keeping their separation clean and interfaces abstract.

### Summary

Microservices are powerful but often misunderstood. Their key characteristics are their small size, focus on accomplishing a single task, alignment with a bounded context, autonomy, independent deployability, and loose coupling. Properly implemented microservices can provide significant benefits to developmental processes and organizational growth, but they also come with challenges and costs that must be managed.
