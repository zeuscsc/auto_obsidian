## Voice Cloning
### Microsoft Research's Voice Cloning

Microsoft Research has developed an AI that clones voices based on only a 3-second sample, a significant improvement from NVIDIA's earlier AI that required 30 minutes of voice samples. [![[/snapshots/F6HSsVIkqIU/00-00-20.png]]](<https://youtu.be/F6HSsVIkqIU?t=16s>)

### Rapid Improvement and Capabilities

With just one more research paper, the required information has been reduced by 600 times. The AI can generate several variants of speech, preserve emotions from the sample, and maintain its ambiance and acoustic environment.

### Evaluation and Comparison

The paper evaluates the new technique against previous ones in terms of word error rate and speaker similarity. The new AI outperforms other techniques, even those published in the same year, showing the rapid progress in voice cloning research. 

### Potential Applications

Voice cloning can bring back the voices of people who are no longer with us, allowing them to read books and stories or have their voices used in various applications. This technology also raises questions about whose voices we might want to hear in the future.
