## Hugging Face Agents
### Hugging Face Agents Introduction

#### The Importance of Hugging Face Agents [![[/snapshots/-xAeqi_2cis/00-16-50.png]]](<https://youtu.be/-xAeqi_2cis?t=1007s>)
Hugging Face has announced their spin on agents for large language models and transformers.  
Their implementation is interesting and powerful due to: [![[/snapshots/-xAeqi_2cis/00-02-43.png]]](<https://youtu.be/-xAeqi_2cis?t=159s>)
- The huge community and hub that Hugging Face has for transformer models, diffusion models, datasets, and more. [![[/snapshots/-xAeqi_2cis/00-02-57.png]]](<https://youtu.be/-xAeqi_2cis?t=171s>)
- The ease of using multi-modal agents, integrations with the community-contributed tools. [![[/snapshots/-xAeqi_2cis/00-08-32.png]]](<https://youtu.be/-xAeqi_2cis?t=509s>)
- The readability of the code. [![[/snapshots/-xAeqi_2cis/00-11-29.png]]](<https://youtu.be/-xAeqi_2cis?t=688s>)

#### What are Agents and Tools? [![[/snapshots/-xAeqi_2cis/00-00-32.png]]](<https://youtu.be/-xAeqi_2cis?t=27s>)
Large language models (LLMs) answer questions in natural language based on input. Agents extend LLMs by allowing them to have multiple sets of reasoning and thoughts. Tools can be integrated, letting the LLM ask for help from different tools like Google search or SQL databases. [![[/snapshots/-xAeqi_2cis/00-00-44.png]]](<https://youtu.be/-xAeqi_2cis?t=38s>)

#### Code Examples
The example provided uses OpenAI's Text API and Hugging Face's Agents Library. The code shows different tasks performed by the agents, like generating images or image captioning. [![[/snapshots/-xAeqi_2cis/00-07-26.png]]](<https://youtu.be/-xAeqi_2cis?t=442s>)

#### Conversational Agent Example
The example showcases a conversation where an agent is asked to create an image, modify it, and caption it. The multitasking capabilities are impressive and are made simple to integrate into the code. 

#### Community Aspect
There is a massive community aspect to Hugging Face agents, and it is expected that the community will contribute many tools. Being able to easily access these shared tools will bring a lot of potential to the platform. [![[/snapshots/-xAeqi_2cis/00-00-22.png]]](<https://youtu.be/-xAeqi_2cis?t=16s>)
