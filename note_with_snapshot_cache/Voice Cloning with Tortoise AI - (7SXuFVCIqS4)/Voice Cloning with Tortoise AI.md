### Steps to Clone a Voice using Tortoise AI [![[/snapshots/7SXuFVCIqS4/00-02-49.png]]](<https://youtu.be/7SXuFVCIqS4?t=168s>)

1. Prepare an audio track with the voice you want to clone (WAV format). Use Audacity, a free audio editing tool to create 10-second clips of the voice. [![[/snapshots/7SXuFVCIqS4/00-00-54.png]]](<https://youtu.be/7SXuFVCIqS4?t=52s>)
2. Head over to Google Colab, which allows you to run the code without using your own hardware or coding knowledge. Click the link in the description and hit the play buttons on the left side of each code block. [![[/snapshots/7SXuFVCIqS4/00-01-29.png]]](<https://youtu.be/7SXuFVCIqS4?t=88s>)
