### Conclusion: Instant NGP for Creators 
The binary release of Instant NGP makes it easier than ever for creators to use the software for creating and training NeRF models. However, customization is limited for those who may want to modify Python binaries. Overall, this update simplifies the process, making Instant NGP accessible to a broader audience.
