LangChain
### Introduction to LangChain
LangChain is a framework for developing applications using large language models, like OpenAI's GPT models. It allows applications to become data aware and agentic, connecting to other data sources and interacting with the environment.

### LangChain Modules
1. Models: LangChain supports a variety of models from OpenAI, HuggingFace, and others. [![[/snapshots/NYSWn1ipbgg/00-04-11.png]]](<https://youtu.be/NYSWn1ipbgg?t=248s>)
2. Prompts: Manage, optimize and serialize prompts using the Prompt Template class. [![[/snapshots/NYSWn1ipbgg/00-05-40.png]]](<https://youtu.be/NYSWn1ipbgg?t=337s>)
3. Memory: Utilize Conversational Chains for both short- and long-term memory. [![[/snapshots/NYSWn1ipbgg/00-07-03.png]]](<https://youtu.be/NYSWn1ipbgg?t=420s>)
4. Indexes: Improve language model capabilities by combining with your own text data. [![[/snapshots/NYSWn1ipbgg/00-14-42.png]]](<https://youtu.be/NYSWn1ipbgg?t=879s>)
5. Chains: Sequences of calls to large language models, using standard interfaces and integrations. [![[/snapshots/NYSWn1ipbgg/00-05-36.png]]](<https://youtu.be/NYSWn1ipbgg?t=335s>)
6. Agents: Large language models making decisions, taking actions, observing, and repeating. [![[/snapshots/NYSWn1ipbgg/00-11-11.png]]](<https://youtu.be/NYSWn1ipbgg?t=668s>)

### Document Loaders, Text Splitters, and Vector Stores [![[/snapshots/NYSWn1ipbgg/00-08-50.png]]](<https://youtu.be/NYSWn1ipbgg?t=528s>)
Using LangChain, you can create intelligent applications for companies by loading data from various sources, such as YouTube, PDFs, and Notion. Text splitters allow you to split large data into smaller chunks, and vector stores let you perform similarity searches to find relevant information.

### Creating a YouTube Assistant
Using LangChain, you can create an AI assistant that answers questions about specific YouTube videos. This involves loading the video's transcript, splitting it into smaller chunks, indexing it in vector databases, and chaining large language models to answer user queries based on the indexed data.
