## Knowledge Graphs
### Introduction to Knowledge Graphs
Knowledge Graphs are an AI technology used in major platforms and systems to provide accurate and specific information. They are used in search engines, question answering and recommendation systems. [![[/snapshots/PZBm7M0HGzw/00-00-05.png]]](<https://youtu.be/PZBm7M0HGzw?t=2s>)

### Knowledge Graphs vs. Knowledge Bases [![[/snapshots/PZBm7M0HGzw/00-00-01.png]]](<https://youtu.be/PZBm7M0HGzw?t=0s>)
Knowledge Graphs help computers better understand complex relations between different pieces of data. The term "Knowledge Graph" was coined by Google but it is based on the principles of earlier technologies called Knowledge Bases.

### Structure of Knowledge Graphs
Knowledge Graphs are mathematical graphs consisting of nodes (entities) and edges (relations). For example, a node could be Bush House, and an edge could be its address. Edges have labels, such as "has_address" or "has_picture". 

### Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs
Knowledge Graphs are based on ontologies which describe abstract concepts like cities, buildings, and institutions. Ontologies help provide inferred knowledge. For example, if Bush House is located in London and London is located in England, the computer can infer that Bush House is located in England.

### Accessing Knowledge Graphs
Developers can access the Google Knowledge Graph API or explore open-source knowledge graphs like Wikidata, which is used to manage structured information on Wikipedia. [![[/snapshots/PZBm7M0HGzw/00-10-57.png]]](<https://youtu.be/PZBm7M0HGzw?t=655s>)

### Intelligence, Sentience and Consciousness
Computers can be considered intelligent in some aspects, but there's a distinction between intelligence, sentience, and consciousness. Knowledge Graphs contribute to the aspect of intelligence in computer systems. [![[/snapshots/PZBm7M0HGzw/00-11-49.png]]](<https://youtu.be/PZBm7M0HGzw?t=706s>)
