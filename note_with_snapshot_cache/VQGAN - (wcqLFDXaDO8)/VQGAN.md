## VQGAN
### Introduction to VQGAN
VQGAN, which stands for Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks, is a powerful model for image generation that combines existing methods to produce high-resolution images. It is an extension of the VQVAE model and incorporates it into the GAN architecture. This model can generate images much larger than it was trained on.

### Recap of VQVAE
VQVAE is an abbreviation for Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder. It is an improved autoencoder that focuses on learning a mapping (encoding) from the image space to a low-dimensional latent space and then reconstructing (decoding) the image back into image space. VQVAE addresses the problems of the original autoencoder by reparametrizing the latent space and turning the continuous latent space into a discrete one, which helps in the learning process.

### Using GANs with VQVAE
To integrate VQVAE into the GAN architecture, the authors added a discriminator to the VQVAE. The generator, which is the decoder part of VQVAE, along with the discriminator, helps in learning the representations better by providing additional supervision during the training process.

### Second Stage: Generating New Images [![[/snapshots/wcqLFDXaDO8/00-07-33.png]]](<https://youtu.be/wcqLFDXaDO8?t=451s>)
After training the VQGAN, we can then generate completely new images from the data distribution using the learned codebooks and a transformer. The transformer learns the relationships between the codebook vectors and is able to sample new latent vectors to create new images.

### Model Details: Encoder, Decoder, Codebook, and Discriminator [![[/snapshots/wcqLFDXaDO8/00-09-45.png]]](<https://youtu.be/wcqLFDXaDO8?t=583s>)
The VQGAN consists of four sub-models: the encoder, decoder, codebook, and discriminator. The encoder and decoder are simple CNN architectures, while the codebook is represented as an embedding matrix. The discriminator is based on the PatchGAN architecture.

### Training VQGAN
The training process consists of two stages: an end-to-end training stage in which encoder, decoder, codebook, and discriminator are all learned simultaneously, and a transformer training stage in which the transformer is trained autoregressively to generate new images.

### Loss Functions
The loss function for VQGAN is composed of two parts: the reconstruction loss from VQVAE, which includes a pixel-wise mean squared error, perceptual loss, and vector quantization terms, and the GAN loss, which involves the discriminator trying to correctly classify real and fake images.
