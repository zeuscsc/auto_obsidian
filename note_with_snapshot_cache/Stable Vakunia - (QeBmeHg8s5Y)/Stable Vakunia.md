## Stable Vakunia
### Introduction to Stable Vakunia

Stable Vakunia is a fine-tuned version of the Vakunia 13 billion parameter model, which is currently the king of local LLMs. This model was fine-tuned using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on three datasets: Open Assistant, GPT4All, and Alpaca. The result should improve the model and make it better at chatting with users. [![[/snapshots/QeBmeHg8s5Y/00-01-17.png]]](<https://youtu.be/QeBmeHg8s5Y?t=74s>)

### Comparison of Stable Vakunia and Vakunia [![[/snapshots/QeBmeHg8s5Y/00-15-04.png]]](<https://youtu.be/QeBmeHg8s5Y?t=901s>)

Several tests were conducted to compare Stable Vakunia and the base Vakunia model. These tests included general knowledge questions, creativity (writing a poem), summarization, translation, math and coding, and content sensitivity. Stable Vakunia performed better than Vakunia in most of the tests, except for the math and coding questions, where both models struggled. Stable Vakunia is now considered the new king of the 13 billion parameter models. [![[/snapshots/QeBmeHg8s5Y/00-02-40.png]]](<https://youtu.be/QeBmeHg8s5Y?t=157s>)

### Installation and Usage

To use Stable Vakunia, make sure you have UBAWUGA Tech Generation Web UI installed. Download the Stable Vakunia model and reload it in the Web UI. When using the model, make sure to use the Vakunia V0 instruction template to avoid the model talking to itself. Stable Vakunia uses around 9.5 gigabytes of VRAM but could use less depending on other running applications. [![[/snapshots/QeBmeHg8s5Y/00-04-14.png]]](<https://youtu.be/QeBmeHg8s5Y?t=252s>)

### Conclusion

Stable Vakunia is an improved version of the Vakunia 13 billion parameter model and is now considered the new king in its category. With consistent improvements being made on these models, the reign of the current models may be short-lived as newer and better models continue to be developed.
