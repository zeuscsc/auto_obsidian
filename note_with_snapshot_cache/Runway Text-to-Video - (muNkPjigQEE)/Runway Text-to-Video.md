## Runway Text-to-Video
### Introduction to Two Minute Papers [![[/snapshots/muNkPjigQEE/00-00-02.png]]](<https://youtu.be/muNkPjigQEE?t=0s>)
Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér presents a discussion about Text-to-Video systems, Google's Image & Video system, and NVIDIA's Video Maker AI. Unfortunately, as of the creation of this video, there are no easy ways to try these systems out yet. [![[/snapshots/muNkPjigQEE/00-00-08.png]]](<https://youtu.be/muNkPjigQEE?t=5s>)

### Image Operations in Runway
Runway also provides various image operations that can be used in combination with the Gen 1 video-to-video system, such as expanding images or erasing parts of an image and replacing them with a text prompt. [![[/snapshots/muNkPjigQEE/00-02-16.png]]](<https://youtu.be/muNkPjigQEE?t=133s>)

### Creating Videos from Photos
Runway's creative suite allows users to generate videos from a few photos taken a few seconds apart. The system understands the content of the images and synthesizes the pixels in between to create a video. [![[/snapshots/muNkPjigQEE/00-02-25.png]]](<https://youtu.be/muNkPjigQEE?t=142s>)

The text-to-video functionality in Runway is still in the testing phase and expected to be part of the main suite within a few weeks. Dr. Zsolnai-Fehér shares his first experience with the text-to-video function by generating videos of fluid simulations and fellow scholars holding on to their papers. 

### Potential Impact of Runway's Text-to-Video Feature [![[/snapshots/muNkPjigQEE/00-02-58.png]]](<https://youtu.be/muNkPjigQEE?t=175s>)
With the release of Runway's text-to-video feature, it is anticipated that creative individuals will have access to an incredible system to bring their ideas to life in video form, potentially revolutionizing the future of video making.
