Editable NeRF
### Introducing Editable NeRF

We propose **Editable NeRF**, an approach for creating editable topologically varying neural radiance fields. Users can easily edit dynamic scenes using surface key points. The network is trained using an image sequence captured by a single camera, and it enables users to edit the scene by dragging key points to new positions for rendering videos.

### Editing Dynamic Scenes
With Editable NeRF, users can perform various editing actions, such as sliding piano keys or moving objects like cups. These modified scenes can then be transformed into new video content. 

### Comparison with Conurf
Editable NeRF outperforms the state-of-the-art method Conurf, due to its up to three-dimensional editing capabilities and lack of user annotations. Conurf only supports one-dimensional editing and requires user input. [![[/snapshots/Eu2twgbg4kI/00-01-34.png]]](<https://youtu.be/Eu2twgbg4kI?t=89s>)

### Driving Modeled Scenes with Other Sequences [![[/snapshots/Eu2twgbg4kI/00-02-12.png]]](<https://youtu.be/Eu2twgbg4kI?t=119s>)
The Editable NeRF method allows for driving the created scenes with motions from other sequences, showcasing its versatility. 

### Graphical User Interface Implementation
Editable NeRF features an intuitive graphical user interface that allows users to easily edit scenes, change viewpoints, and record and edit sequences before rendering a final video.
