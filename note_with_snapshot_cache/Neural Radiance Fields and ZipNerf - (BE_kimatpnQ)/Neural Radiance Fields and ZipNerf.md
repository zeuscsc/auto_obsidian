This video explains the technology behind AI-generated videos using a neural image rendering algorithm called Neural Radiance Fields (NERF) and its variant, ZipNerf. 

### NERF: Rendering 3D Scenes from 2D Images [![[/snapshots/BE_kimatpnQ/00-00-41.png]]](<https://youtu.be/BE_kimatpnQ?t=37s>)
NERF takes a set of 2D images of a 3D scene and trains deep neural networks to synthesize new images from various camera positions and angles. It uses a fully connected dense neural network to input XYZ coordinates and ray directions to output RGB colors and density at a given position. The end result is a highly compressed representation of the entire 3D scene. 

### Rendering Images with Hierarchical Volume Sampling [![[/snapshots/BE_kimatpnQ/00-07-18.png]]](<https://youtu.be/BE_kimatpnQ?t=434s>)
NERF uses a hierarchical volume sampling method, which involves shooting out rays from each pixel, evaluating them using a coarse network, and then focusing on important sampling regions with a fine network. Positional encodings are used to train the neural networks, allowing for more efficient image rendering. [![[/snapshots/BE_kimatpnQ/00-04-37.png]]](<https://youtu.be/BE_kimatpnQ?t=275s>)

### Limitations of Original NERF and Improvements with ZipNerf [![[/snapshots/BE_kimatpnQ/00-00-59.png]]](<https://youtu.be/BE_kimatpnQ?t=55s>)
The original NERF had limitations such as aliasing artifacts and slow training times. ZipNerf, a variant of NERF, addresses these issues and improves the overall image quality and performance of the neural networks. 

### NVIDIA Labs' Instant NGP: Speeding Up NERF Training [![[/snapshots/BE_kimatpnQ/00-06-43.png]]](<https://youtu.be/BE_kimatpnQ?t=398s>)
In 2022, NVIDIA Labs introduced Instant NGP to speed up NERF training by optimizing it with CUDA and GPU drivers, training small MLP layers, and using multi-resolution hash encoding. This method allows for real-time training and inference, as well as gigapixel image approximation. 

### ZipNerf: Casting Cones Instead of Rays and Addressing Z Aliasing [![[/snapshots/BE_kimatpnQ/00-09-35.png]]](<https://youtu.be/BE_kimatpnQ?t=572s>)
ZipNerf further improves on the hashing idea by casting cones instead of rays into the scene, allowing for super sampling to reduce noise and anti-aliasing. Additionally, it addresses Z aliasing by introducing proposal supervision, a technique that optimizes the proposal network to reduce tearing artifacts in the final rendered images.

### Conclusion
ZipNerf is an incredible piece of technology that produces high-quality AI-generated videos with consistent results, albeit at a slower pace than instant NGP. This research area continues to advance, pushing the boundaries of AI-generated content and neural image rendering.
